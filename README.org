My passion project is [[https://github.com/hraban/cl-nix-lite][cl-nix-lite]], a Common Lisp package scope for Nix, without Quicklisp.

I also maintain [[https://github.com/hraban/tomono][tomono]], a multi-to-monorepository merge tool. Itâ€™s written entirely as a Literate Program.

My work is dual licensed under AGPLv3 and commercial licensing.
